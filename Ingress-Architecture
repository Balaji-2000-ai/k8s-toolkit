User → Cloud LoadBalancer → Ingress Controller Pod → ClusterIP Service → Pods
The user makes a request: https://myapp.example.com
In the cloud, the Ingress Controller creates a cloud load balancer automatically (AWS → ELB). This cloud-managed LoadBalancer has a public IP, which is where user traffic first lands
The load balancer forwards traffic into the cluster to the Ingress Controller. The Ingress Controller is just a pod running inside Kubernetes, but it is exposed to the outside world through:Service type: LoadBalancer
The Ingress Controller receives the request, reads the rules in the Ingress resource, and decides which backend service should handle the request.
The Ingress Controller then forwards traffic to ClusterIP service for the application which are accessible only inside the cluster, not from outside
Finally, the ClusterIP service load-balances traffic to your application pods




Application Services Stay as ClusterIP:

Ingress replaces NodePort/LoadBalancer for apps. So application services do not need external exposure
If each application exposed itself using NodePort/LoadBalancer, it would be Hard to manage, Insecure, Expensive (cloud LB cost!), Messy with many public endpoints
So only the Ingress Controller is exposed externally. All other app services remain internal (ClusterIP)
