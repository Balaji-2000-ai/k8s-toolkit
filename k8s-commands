kubectl create -f podcreation.yml: Creates Kubernetes resources (such as Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.) defined inside the podcreation.yml file
kubectl apply -f manifest_file.yml → Creates or updates Kubernetes resources defined in the specified YAML manifest file, applying any changes without deleting existing configurations
kubectl get po pod_name: Displays the status and details of a specific pod by name, including its phase, age, and restart count
kubectl get po pod_name -o wide: Shows detailed information about the specified pod, including its node assignment, pod IP, container images, and other extended metadata beyond the default output
kubectl get po pod_name -o yaml: Displays the complete YAML representation of the specified pod, including metadata, specification, and current status
kubectl get po pod_name -o json: Displays the complete JSON representation of the specified pod, including metadata, spec, and current status
kubectl get po -o wide: Lists all pods in the current namespace with extended details such as pod IPs, node names, and container images
kubectl get po -o yaml: Outputs all pod definitions in the current namespace in YAML format, showing full configuration details such as metadata, spec, and status
kubectl get po -o json: Outputs all pods in the current namespace in JSON format, showing full configuration details including metadata, spec, and status
kubectl describe pod pod_name: Displays detailed information about the specified pod, including its containers, events, status, resource usage, node assignment, and any errors or warnings
kubectl delete pod pod_name: Deletes the specified pod from the Kubernetes cluster. The pod’s containers are terminated, and its resources are freed
kubectl delete pod --all: Deletes all pods in the current namespace, terminating their containers and freeing associated resources


kubectl get svc: Lists all services in the current Kubernetes namespace, showing their names, types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), cluster IPs, external IPs, ports, and age
kubectl delete svc svc_name: Deletes the specified service from the Kubernetes cluster, removing its network endpoints and stopping external access to the associated pods
kubectl delete svc --all: Deletes all services in the current namespace, removing their network endpoints and stopping external access to the associated pods

#ReplicationController- Self healing Pods
kubectl get rc: Lists all ReplicationControllers in the current namespace, showing their names, desired vs. current replicas, and age
kubectl describe rc rc_name: Shows detailed information about the specified ReplicationController, including its labels, selector, replica count, pod template, and recent events
kubectl delete rc rc_name: Deletes the specified ReplicationController, which will also terminate the pods it manages unless they are orphaned with additional flags
kubectl delete rc rc_name --cascade=orphan: Deletes the specified ReplicationController but keeps its pods running by orphaning them, meaning they will no longer be managed or monitored by the RC
kubectl scale rc rc_name --replicas 5: Scales the specified ReplicationController to 5 replicas, ensuring it runs five pod instances

kubectl get rs: Lists all ReplicaSets in the current namespace, showing their names, desired/current/ready replicas, and age

kubectl get deployment: Lists all Deployments in the current namespace, showing their names, desired and current replica counts, available pods, and age
kubectl set image deployment/deployment_name container_name=image_name: Updates image for the specified container in a Deployment, triggering a rolling update of the pods managed by that Deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment_name: Shows the revision history of the specified Deployment, including previous versions of the Deployment configuration and container images
kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment_name --to-revision=1: Reverts the specified Deployment to a previous revision (here, revision 1), restoring the Deployment’s pods to the state of that revision
kubectl rollout status deployment/deployment_name: Displays the current rollout status of the specified Deployment, showing whether the update is complete, in progress, or has failed
kubectl rollout pause deployment/deployment_name: Pauses the rollout of the specified Deployment, preventing new updates from being applied to its pods until the rollout is resumed
kubectl rollout resume deployment/deployment_name: Resumes a previously paused Deployment rollout, allowing updates to continue and new pods to be deployed according to the Deployment specification

#s3&cluster
aws s3 ls: Lists all S3 buckets in AWS account
aws s3 mb s3://balaji.practice.k8s: Creates a new S3 bucket named balaji.practice.k8s. The mb command stands for make bucket
aws s3 ls s3://balaji.practice.k8s: Lists all objects (files/folders) stored inside the S3 bucket balaji.practice.k8s
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://bucket_name: Sets the environment variable KOPS_STATE_STORE to point to the specified S3 bucket. This bucket is used by kops to store cluster configuration, state, and metadata
kops create cluster --name cluster_name.k8s.local --zones us-east-1a,us-east-1b --master-size t2.medium --master-count 1 --node-size t2.micro --node-count 2:
 Generates the configuration for a Kubernetes cluster managed by kops, specifying: Cluster name (with .k8s.local DNS suffix), Az's, Master node size&count, Worker node size&count. This prepares, but does not yet build, the cluster
kops update cluster --name cluster_name.k8s.local --yes --admin: Applies the cluster configuration and starts creating the Kubernetes cluster
 --yes executes the changes without prompting, --admin generates temporary admin credentials for accessing the cluster
